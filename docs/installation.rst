Installation
============

For installation get source code from `repo <https://github.com/pydevua/django-testrecorder>`,
and use ``python setup.py install``. Or you can install with ``pip install django-testrecorder``,
but it can contain not up-to-date version.

Edit ``settings.py`` to add ``'testrecorder'`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``.
